            Like most college-age young adults, we spend countless hours every
            day fixated on our electronic devices. On weekdays, internet access
            is a necessity for completing homework assignments; during the
            weekend, the internet becomes a primary source of entertainment. In
            between lectures, a student might casually browse Pinterest, or open
            up Instagram to check in on the activity of their friends. At the
            end of the day, this student pulls up Netflix to wind down, and asks
            Siri on their phone to check tomorrow‚Äôs weather report. We run
            through these actions on repeat in our daily lives, thinking very
            little of any cost or threat they might entail. However, what
            students‚Äîand millions of other internet surfers‚Äîcan fail to
            recognize is the cloud service providers underlying our online
            activity, and the steep environmental cost behind them.

            What, then, is a cloud service? Cloud services can be rudimentarily
            defined as computer system resources that are accessed on demand
            without requiring the user‚Äôs direct and active management (DiMaria,
            2020). Most notably, these services encompass data storage and
            computing power, which companies like Netflix, Pinterest, Instagram,
            etc. harness to resolve existing IT demands or to expand new
            services. Through cloud service providers, firms can simply pay for
            the IT infrastructure they need instead of navigating the upfront
            cost and complexity of developing their own infrastructure and data
            centers (DiMaria, 2020). Take Netflix, for example. The popular
            streaming service deals with large spikes in traffic during
            evenings, significantly subsiding in volume as the night progresses
            into a.m. hours. When Netflix‚Äôs viewership outpaced the capacity of
            its traditional data centers, it turned to a cloud service provider
            to manage its alternating periods of high demand and lulls in
            activity. Instead of diverting resources from its preexisting
            responsibilities as a production company, Netflix‚Äôs partnership with
            Amazon Web Services allows it to outsource ‚Äúdatabases, analytics,
            recommendation engines, video transcoding, and more‚Äîhundreds of
            functions that in total use more than 100,000 server instances on
            AWS‚Äù (‚ÄúNetflix on AWS‚Äù, n.d.). More and more companies across a
            multitude of industries are turning towards cloud solutions and
            providers, a trend magnified by the increased reliance on virtual
            platforms due to the coronavirus pandemic. In fact, GlobalNewswire
            anticipates the global cloud computing market size to grow from
            371.4 billion USD in 2020 to 832.1 billion USD by 2025 (2020).

          <p class="lead">
            If cloud service providers are on the rise, so too are the
            environmental consequences of their services. Within the
            interminable server halls of data centers, air conditioners are
            working constantly to quell the heat released by the engines
            processing digital requests, transactions, etc. Ironically, these
            air conditioning systems must burn carbon in order to dispel heat.
            In a 2019 report led by climate and computing engineer Maxime
            Efoui-Hess, digital technology‚Äîthe elusive, hazy presence we call
            the Cloud‚Äîwas found to have a greater carbon footprint than the air
            transport industry‚Äîthe noisy, hundreds-of-thousands-ton airplanes
            painting their exhaust trails in the sky. In the most efficient
            conditioning systems, water is cooled and then irrigated throughout
            server racks as a more effective convective agent than air, but this
            comes with a high price of millions of gallons of water daily
            (Monserrate, 2022). Moreover, cloud service providers do not intend
            for their infrastructure to minimize energetic cost. Similar to how
            Bitcoin cryptocurrency is inherently designed to reward
            computational power, and therefore energy consumption, data centers
            are ‚Äúa Russian doll of redundancies‚Äù: every system is supplemented
            with back-up systems in order to guarantee that users don‚Äôt face an
            interruption in their online experience (Monserrate, 2022). Even in
            death, cloud services take a toll on the environment. When the
            cables, batteries, transformers, etc. of servers are dismantled,
            they are sentenced to the toxic fate of most e-waste: overflowing
            landfills and often falling upon already-disadvantaged countries and
            communities to deal with.

          <p class="lead">
            Clearly, our regular usage of cloud services comes with a very
            material and real-world burden. The convenience and immediacy of the
            next episode queuing on Netflix, Amazon‚Äôs one-click purchasing
            option, saving files to Dropbox, and so forth can all be traced back
            to an environmental strain imposed by cloud service providers. With
            this knowledge in mind, part of the impetus falls upon users like
            ourselves to more carefully examine our online activity. As we‚Äôve
            seen throughout this semester, the extent of computing‚Äôs
            sustainability‚Äîor lack thereof‚Äîcan vary depending on a company‚Äôs
            particular methods and mindset. In this project, we have taken it
            upon ourselves to critically examine the operations of four leading
            cloud service providers. We hope that the analysis we provide in the
            following pages, and the public website we have generated from our
            investigation, will educate everyday users worldwide on the hidden
            expenses of cloud services and inform their choices as part of the
            target customer base moving forward.
